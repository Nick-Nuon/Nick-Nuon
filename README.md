## Welcome! 🧑‍💻

I am a 🇨🇦 software developer based in Montreal ⚜️.

- ⚡ I improved OpenSSL's base64 encoding by porting Simdutf's algoritm, achieving **4x speedup** over the previous solution. 
- 🚀 I helped add Latin1 support to **Simdutf**, achieving up to **38× speedup** over the popular ICU library. My code is now **in use by Node.js**.
- 💡 I ported two high-performance algorithm from Simdutf to **C#**,achieving significant speedups over existing SIMD-accelerated solutions.
  - **SimdUnicode**: Up to **2.3× speedup**; under consideration for adoption into **.NET**. My code was further ported to **Mojo** by Chris Lattner’s team.
  - **SimdBase64**: Up to **10× speedup**; slated for adoption in **.NET 10**.
  -  📰 I write about my adventures in programming on my [website](https://nick-nuon.github.io/) and my [substack](https://nicknuon.substack.com/).
- 🏆 Twice **NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award** recipient.
- 🧠 I contributed to [several conference papers](https://dblp.org/pid/202/0273.html) in **machine learning**.
- 🎹 I play **classical piano**. Feel free to talk to me about music anytime.
