Welcome! 🧑‍💻

I am a 🇨🇦 software developer based in Montreal.

    📰 I write about my adventures in SIMD optimization on my website.
    🚀 I helped add Latin1 support to Simdutf, achieving up to 38× speedup over the popular ICU library. My code is now used by Node.js.
    💡 I helped port high-performance C++ algorithms to C#, achieving significant speedups over existing SIMD-accelerated solutions:
        SimdUnicode: Up to 2.3× faster than Microsoft's SIMD-accelerated solution; under consideration for adoption into .NET. My code was further ported to Mojo by Chris Lattner’s team.
        SimdBase64: Up to 10× faster; slated for adoption in .NET 10.
    🧠 I contributed to several conference papers in machine learning.
    🏆 Twice NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award recipient.
    🎹 I play classical piano. Feel free to talk to me about music anytime.
